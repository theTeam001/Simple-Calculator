# Simple Command-Line Calculator

A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project is structured into multiple Python modules to demonstrate modular programming and code organization.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into the following Python files:

```
simple-calculator/
│
├── operations.py         # Contains arithmetic operation functions
├── calculator.py         # Contains the calculator logic
├── utils.py              # Utility functions for input validation
├── main.py               # Entry point to run the calculator
```

### Modules Description:

- **`operations.py`**: This module contains functions to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **`calculator.py`**: This module handles user interaction, prompting the user for input and invoking the appropriate operation functions from `operations.py`.
- **`utils.py`**: Provides utility functions like input validation. This module is designed for expanding the input validation logic.
- **`main.py`**: The entry point of the program, where the `calculator()` function from `calculator.py` is called to run the program.

## Features

- Performs four basic arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.
- Handles errors like invalid operator input and division by zero.
- Allows the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-calculator.git
   cd simple-calculator
   ```

2. The project doesn't require any external dependencies, so no additional installation steps are needed.

## Usage

1. To start the calculator, run the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. You will be prompted to enter two numbers and choose an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).

3. The calculator will display the result and ask if you want to perform another calculation. Type `y` for yes or `n` to exit the program.

### Example Interaction:
```
Simple Calculator
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0
Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): y
Enter first number: 20
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): /
Enter second number: 4
Result: 5.0
Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): n
```

## How It Works

1. **`operations.py`** defines basic functions for each arithmetic operation:
   - `add(x, y)`
   - `subtract(x, y)`
   - `multiply(x, y)`
   - `divide(x, y)`

2. **`calculator.py`** handles user input, prompts for the numbers and operator, performs the calculation using functions from `operations.py`, and prints the result.

3. **`utils.py`** provides helper functions, such as validating the user's input to ensure that only valid numbers are entered.

4. **`main.py`** is the entry point for the program. It calls the `calculator()` function to start the interactive calculator.

## Error Handling

- The calculator checks for division by zero and raises an appropriate error message if the user attempts to divide by zero.
- If the user enters an invalid number or operator, an error message will be displayed and the program will prompt the user to try again.
